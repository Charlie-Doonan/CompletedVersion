    "goalsInfo1Para": "Life on Land is a sustainability goal that aims to protect and restore ecosystems, prevent desertification and sustainably manage forests. One of the main causes of deforestation is agricultural expansion and contributes around 90% of global deforestation. Forests are home to more than 80% of all terrestrial species with biodiversity declining faster than at any other time in human history. Over 100 million hectares of heathy and productive land were degraded every year between 2015 and 2019 which effects around 1.3 billion people.",
    "goalsInfo2Para": "Climate action is a sustainability goal aimed at reducing global warming and climate change as a whole. Climate change effects every person on the planet. It is caused by activities of humans and threatens life on earth as we know it. If we are not prepared, climate change will undo a lot of the development progress we have made over the past years. It will provoke mass migration and will cause instability and even war.",
    "goalsInfo3Para": "Life below water is a sustainability goal which is focused on protecting and sustaining healthy oceans. Oceans covers around  three quarters of the earths surface. They provide key natural resources such as food, medicines and biofuels. However, marine pollution is reaching extreme levels, with over 17 million metric tons of pollution in 2021. This figure is set to double by 2040. In 2023 the oceanâ€™s average pH was 8.1 which is about 30% more acidic than in pre-industrial times. Ocean acidification threatens the survival of marine life, disrupts the food web, and undermines vital services provided by the ocean and our own food security.",
